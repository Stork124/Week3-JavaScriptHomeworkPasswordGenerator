# Week3-JavaScriptHomeworkPasswordGenerator
Attempted to create a random password generator. 
After making some head way with the prompts on my own i could not quite figure out how to store all of the user inputs in order to generate the password.
I used the master JavaScript file and tried to work my way backwords through the file in order to recreate it and understand as much i could. 
I mirrored the code while creating my own variable and function names and left out the things i dont understand at the moment
