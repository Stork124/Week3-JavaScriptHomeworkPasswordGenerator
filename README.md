# Week3-JavaScriptHomeworkPasswordGenerator
Attempted to create a random password generator.
was able to initiat the criteria prompts when the button was pressed but was not sure how to appropriately store the inputs for later use.
Used the master JavaScript file to mirror code while working backwords to understand the process. 
Created most of my own vaiable names and function names for the parts that i understood and left out code that i did not.
Do not know why my githubpages link brings up either a 4-4 or this README.md page.
